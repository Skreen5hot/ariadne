# Epistemic Vocabulary Mapping

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Purpose:** Unified mapping across the four epistemic quality systems in the ARIADNE ecosystem
**Status:** Draft
**Addresses:** T-010 (Epistemic Quality Vocabulary Fragmentation)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Four specifications describe epistemic quality using different vocabularies, scales, and conceptual frames. While each serves a distinct purpose, the lack of explicit mapping creates integration ambiguity when information flows between components.

---

## 2. The Four Systems

### 2.1 FNSR Taint Levels (Pipeline-Level)

Source: FNSR Architecture v2.1 §9

Taint levels track epistemic contamination as information flows through the processing pipeline. They are **monotonically increasing** — information can only become more tainted, never less.

| Level | Name | Meaning | Production Use |
|-------|------|---------|----------------|
| L0 | Verified | From trusted sources with independent verification | Yes |
| L1 | Derived | Derived from L0 premises via valid inference | Yes |
| L2 | Defeasible | May be overridden by new information | Yes (maximum for production) |
| L3 | Speculative | Generated by abductive reasoning or gap-filling | No (sandbox only) |
| L4 | Hypothetical | Generated by counterfactual simulation | No (cannot escape sandbox) |
| L5 | Adversarial | From untrusted or actively hostile sources | No (immediate quarantine) |

**Contamination rule:** L3 + L0 → L3 (speculation contaminates).

### 2.2 MDRE Evidence Tiers (Assertion-Level)

Source: MDRE Technical Specification v1.3 §7-8

Evidence tiers classify the *type of evidence* supporting an actuality assertion. They determine what predicates an evidence source can assert.

| Tier | Evidence Type | Can Assert `actual/2` | Can Assert `claimed_actual/3` | Trust Requirement |
|------|--------------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Observation | Yes | Yes | Verified observer |
| 2 | Record | Yes | Yes | Official record source |
| 3 | Attestation | No | Yes | Identified attestor |
| 4 | Report | No | Yes | Known reporter |
| 5 | Claim | No | Yes | Any source |

**Key distinction:** Only Tier 1-2 evidence can assert something *actually happened*. Tier 3-5 can only assert that something was *claimed to have happened*.

### 2.3 PFCF Uncertainty Types (Function-Level)

Source: PFCF v2.1 §4.5

PFCF classifies the *type of uncertainty* a function introduces, using a two-axis model (uncertainty type x reproducibility).

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Deterministic | Output fully determined by input | Hash function |
| Aleatory | Output involves genuine randomness | Monte Carlo simulation |
| Epistemic | Output reflects model uncertainty or incomplete knowledge | LLM inference |
| Mixed | Both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty | Bayesian inference with sampling |

**Composition rules:** Deterministic + Epistemic = Epistemic. Aleatory + Epistemic = Mixed.

### 2.4 TagTeam Certainty Markers (Linguistic-Level)

Source: TagTeam Roadmap v6.6.0 §7.2

TagTeam detects lexical markers of certainty in natural language input. These are metadata annotations on parsed claims, not quality assessments.

| Marker Type | Examples | Effect |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Hedges | "might," "possibly," "seems" | Reduce certainty |
| Boosters | "definitely," "clearly," "must" | Increase certainty |

---

## 3. Cross-System Mapping

### 3.1 Conceptual Relationship

These four systems operate at **different architectural levels** and are not interchangeable:

```
Linguistic level:   TagTeam certainty markers (hedges/boosters)
                         ↓ (parsed into structured claims)
Assertion level:    MDRE evidence tiers (what kind of evidence backs an assertion)
                         ↓ (claims flow through pipeline)
Pipeline level:     FNSR taint levels (how contaminated is this information)
                         ↓ (functions process claims)
Function level:     PFCF uncertainty types (what kind of uncertainty does processing add)
```

### 3.2 Directional Mappings

#### TagTeam → MDRE

TagTeam certainty markers inform but do not determine MDRE evidence tiers. A booster ("definitely paid") does not upgrade evidence tier — the evidence type (observation vs. claim) is determined by the source, not the language.

| TagTeam Signal | MDRE Implication |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Hedge detected | Flag for `claimed_actual/3` rather than `actual/2` |
| Booster detected | No upgrade — boosters do not change evidence tier |
| No marker | Default to evidence tier based on source classification |

#### MDRE → FNSR

MDRE evidence tiers contribute to FNSR taint level assignment:

| MDRE Evidence Tier | Typical FNSR Taint | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Tier 1 (Observation) | L0 (Verified) | Independently verified |
| Tier 2 (Record) | L0-L1 (Verified/Derived) | Official source, may need derivation |
| Tier 3 (Attestation) | L2 (Defeasible) | Could be overridden |
| Tier 4 (Report) | L2 (Defeasible) | Third-party, non-official |
| Tier 5 (Claim) | L2-L3 (Defeasible/Speculative) | Unverified, depends on context |

#### PFCF → FNSR

PFCF uncertainty types affect taint propagation through functions:

| PFCF Uncertainty Type | Taint Effect |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Deterministic | Taint level preserved (no new uncertainty added) |
| Aleatory | Taint level preserved (randomness is known and bounded) |
| Epistemic | Taint level may increase (model uncertainty adds epistemic contamination) |
| Mixed | Taint level may increase (epistemic component dominates) |

### 3.3 What This Mapping Does NOT Do

- **Does not unify the vocabularies.** Each system serves a distinct purpose at a distinct level.
- **Does not create numeric equivalences.** MDRE Tier 3 ≠ FNSR L3. The scales are not aligned.
- **Does not replace system-specific semantics.** Each spec retains authority over its own vocabulary.

## 4. Implementation Guidance

When a claim flows through the processing pipeline:

1. **TagTeam** annotates the claim with certainty markers (hedges/boosters)
2. **ECCPS** validates the claim structure and assigns initial taint level
3. **MDRE** classifies the evidence type (Tier 1-5) and determines assertion mode (`actual/2` vs. `claimed_actual/3`)
4. **FNSR** tracks the cumulative taint level as the claim flows through services
5. **Each function** in the pipeline declares its PFCF uncertainty type, which governs whether it can increase taint

All four systems are visible in the final output via CloudEvents headers and claim metadata, supporting the non-negotiable commitment to **Uncertainty Visible** (The Plot §2.1).
